	<p>A fully equipped center that provides free vocational training is successfully running in the impoverished districts of Kolkata, Bardhaman, Rajpur/ Sonarpur, Thakurpukur,Goragacha and Birbhum.  The participation rate of this school has increased significantly, and it is even drawing participants from other surrounding slums. 
	<br><br><img src="images/projects/SAM_1742s.JPG" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">Varosha even provides stipends to students who otherwise would be unable to participate.  These students were previously working in menial labor jobs for small pay, but were so reliant on this income that they could not leave their jobs for further training.  Varosha provides them with stipends that enable them to meet their living expenses while they are being trained.
	<br><br>The school now offers a “Second-level Advanced Training Program,” through which students can become “Master Tailors” in order to continue improving their professional opportunities.  The school has already trained many students who are now gainfully employed and self-sufficient.  Moreover, the school serves as a center where community members can seek support from fellow students and teachers, and look forward to a better future.</p>
	<br><br><img src="images/projects/SAM_1740s.JPG" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="left" class="pict-r"><b>Sucess Stories</b>
	<br>Sharmila Singh, Soma Das, and Pampa Das: In just three months (April - June 2007), these three girls have learned how to make garments such as blouses, salwar kameez, petticoats, and pants. They are fully trained and are now earning enough money each month to support their families.  They have joined a large group of successful ladies of Ajanta Basti who have already significantly improved their families’ earnings.
	</div>
	
	<div id="pop2" class="popbox">
	<p>This school has inspired and excited many younger-generation participants, and is running at full capacity.
	<img src="images/projects/Beauty-2-33-3-NGO1110s.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">
	Many students who have been trained are already employed and are contributing much-needed income to their families.  More importantly, there is always an air of hope and positivity within the school-walls, and the classes provide a healthy break from the hardships of everyday life for these young girls.  The girls are learning various cosmetology specialties, including hair removal, manicures, pedicures, bleaching, facials and massages, and make-up (including Indian bridal make-up).

	<div id="pop3" class="popbox">
	<p>The  villages near Bamchandipur, Bardhaman are among the poorest areas in West Bengal. These areas had traditionally been farm working communities before the land was put to other uses by foreign corporations.  The locals are now devastated by poverty, lack of education, and a lack of any vocational skills. Their lack of employment is not only hurting their own future, but robbing their childrens’ futures as well. While their mothers and fathers leave the villages to look for work in nearby cities, the older children are forced to drop out of school and watch their younger siblings at home. Few of the village’s children regularly attend school.
	<br><br>
	VAROSHA will help break this vicious cycle by providing a meaningful profession to the girls and women of the village. VAROSHA has launched one of its most challenging projects -- called JORIR ALO (Light of the metal threads) -- to train village girls and women in metal thread-work on fabrics. VAROSHA arranged all of the necessary financial and logistical support for this project, from conception to completion. VAROSHA provided step-by-step guidance and support, allowing its local partners to start the project within three months of conception.
	<img src="images/projects/4-16-1-nos.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">
The training will allow each and every trained woman to earn a wage that can provide a decent living for her family. They will be able to pass their trade along to their children, making the vocation sustainable for future generations. Importantly, the project will allow the women to stay in their own village and allow their older children to attend school.  And not to be overlooked, VAROSHA provides full nutritious meals to the women during their training.
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/projects/4-17-1-06565s.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="left" class="pict-r">
VAROSHA is expecting at least 60-70 families to start earning a decent wage each year. They may not become rich, but they will be able to provide three square meals, a decent place to live, and the opportunity to earn an education to their children. This will have a tremendously positive impact in these villages. Varosha has replicated the same model in Sonarpur-Rajpur area under "Sonar-alo" project. 30 women are becoming economically self-sufficient every 6 months through this trade.Similar effort in Nagra village in Bardhaman is preparing 20 women in same trade.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="pop4" class="popbox">
	<p>Varosha-trained women are now manufacturing clothing for different vendors.  
	<img src="images/projects/5-1-2-dsc06494s.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">Varosha is providing all necessary costs for raw materials, supplies, and other support. 
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="pop5" class="popbox">
	<p>During October 2007, Varosha successfully launched its most challenging program to date, VIJOY (Varosha In a Journey Of Yours), which helps women become truly self-sufficient by  starting their own enterprises.  Through its Jori work, Embroidery, Mechanized Embroidery Beautician, Tailoring schools,  Mushroom  cultivation, and Aqua/Poly Culture Varosha trains impoverished women to become certified tailors and beauticians.  Through VIJOY, Varosha provides these women with financial and operational assistance to help them start their own tailoring and beautician enterprises.  To date, thirteen VIJOY participants have started their own enterprises.  Varosha provides capital, and helps the women develop budgets, timelines, and benchmark goals.  Varosha’s hope is that these women will become completely independent owners of their own businesses.  
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/projects/3-3-2-NGO1099s.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">This project is not a handout.  Varosha provides financial assistance through interest-free loans, and expects all program participants to honor the terms of those loans.  When the VIJOY participants become self-sufficient and repay their loans, Varosha will redistribute these funds to a new group of participants.  
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/projects/7-1-1-084s.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="left" class="pict-r">Varosha is thus uniquely positioned as a provider of “end-to-end support”: it not only trains participants, but also helps them start their own enterprises.
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/projects/7-2-1-082s.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">Vijoy has created a renewed sense of excitement in the slum.  The women are now looking towards the future with hope and optimism.  This is the first time that they have been recognized as dependable and productive members of society.

	</div>

	<div id="pop6" class="popbox">
	<p>Varosha is fully funding a computer school in Behala, Kolkota, in order to provide participants with a working knowledge of this “must-know” subject.  
	<img src="images/projects/4-4-1-IMG3009.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="right" class="pict-r">Prajukti focuses on the children of the slum, who are falling behind in formal schools because they have no computer access or training like their more affluent peers.  The center also accepts students who are not yet attending formal schools, to make sure that they have the skills to allow them to compete with more affluent children from Day 1 of their schooling.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="pop7" class="popbox">
	<p>Varosha has always believed in providing a clean and wholesome environment for the participants of its programs. 
	<img src="images/projects/3-34-2-NGO1002.png" style="border: thick #282320 solid" align="left" class="pict-r">Under the umbrella of "Paribesh," Varosha provided bathroom facilities in its community center, and throughout 2008 will fund repairs to the roof of the community center.  Through these projects, Varosha is providing regular employment for 10 locals of the slum:

	<div id="pop9" class="popbox">
	<p>Varosha launched this unique program during the “festival” periods of 2007 as a way for Varosha participants to “earn as they learn.”  Members of Varosha’s beautician school designed and developed beautician kits, which they used for in-home beautician services during the major Indian festival periods.  The success of this project has continued even after the festival periods have ended, and the participants continue to “earn as they learn.”
